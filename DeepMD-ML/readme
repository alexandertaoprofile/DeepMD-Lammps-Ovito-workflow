This repository contains a complete DeepMD training setup based on glass datasets, including:

Original XYZ structure files.

set.000/ directory with .npy files for all necessary properties (energies, forces, etc.) for training.

Type mapping files for atomic species.

input.json configuration file for DeepMD training.

Output files including RMSE metrics and visualization of training performance.

LAMMPS dump files generated using the trained .pb DeepMD potential derived from the glass datasets.
