Overview:

This repository contains various LAMMPS simulation scripts for modeling and simulating atomic systems under different conditions, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, defect formation, and stress-strain calculations in materials like iron (Fe). The simulations cover both relaxation and collision dynamics, along with looped iterations to assess system behavior under varying initial conditions and potentials.

Key Simulations:

BCC Iron Structure: Simulates the relaxation of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) iron structure using the EAM potential.

Interstitial and Vacancy Defects: Models defect formation in a metal (Fe) system, calculating formation energies of vacancies and interstitials.

Stress-Strain Simulation: Runs a stress-strain test on a simulated material under different conditions using the NPT and NVE ensembles.

Central Atom Heating: Simulates the heating of a central atom in a BCC structure and applies various fix commands to investigate system response.
